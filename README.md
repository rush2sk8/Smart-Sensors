Smart-Sensors
=============

All the libraries are included in the libraries folder.

All the credit to those libraries go to their respected owners i do not own them i just use them

If you are using the smart sensors gui with this repo then you dont need the jsoup library because it already has the jsoup and apache libraries

This repo contains methods to connect to an EESensors NCAP and retrieve data from a connected WTIM or TIM (Beta). Specifically made to be 
used to demonstrate the plug and play capability of the EESensors TIMs and NCAPs. THIS API IS CREATED FOR WIFI ONLY CONNECTED NCAP USING AN ETHERNET CONNECTION COULD MAKE IT UNSTABLE OR UNUSEABLE.


Fixes:
Fixed major timeout issue
